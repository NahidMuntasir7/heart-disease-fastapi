# Heart Disease Prediction API

A **Machine Learning + FastAPI + Docker** project that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on key health parameters.

This API is built with **FastAPI**, trained using a **Random Forest Classifier**, and containerized with **Docker** for easy deployment.  

It is deployed live on **Render**.


## 📘 About This App

This app provides an easy-to-use API for predicting the presence of heart disease.  

It takes medical input features such as **age**, **cholesterol**, **blood pressure**, etc., and returns whether heart disease is likely (`true` or `false`).

The model was trained using the [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).

## ⚙️ API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:-------|:----------|:-------------|
| `GET`  | `/health` | Health check (returns status OK) |
| `GET`  | `/info`   | Model details and feature list |
| `POST` | `/predict` | Predicts heart disease based on user input |

### 🧠 Example `/predict` Request:
```json
{
  "age": 52,
  "sex": 1,
  "cp": 0,
  "trestbps": 120,
  "chol": 240,
  "fbs": 0,
  "restecg": 1,
  "thalach": 160,
  "exang": 0,
  "oldpeak": 1.0,
  "slope": 2,
  "ca": 0,
  "thal": 2
}
```

### ✅ Example Response:
```json
{
  "heart_disease": false
}
```

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **FastAPI** - for the API backend
- **scikit-learn** - for training the model
- **joblib** - for saving/loading the trained model
- **Docker** - for containerization
- **Render** - for live cloud deployment


## 🧠 How It Works

1. A machine learning model (Random Forest) is trained on heart disease data.
2. The trained model is saved as `model/heart_model.joblib`.
3. FastAPI loads this model and exposes an endpoint (`/predict`) to make predictions.
4. The app is containerized using Docker and deployed to Render.

## 📊 Model Features

The model uses the following features for prediction:

- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
